showhospitalpatients.php improvements:

1. I will use the Symfony framework and will create a controller with an action where I will put the code that gets the patients by hospital. So I will have much more control if I have to apply some more business logic.

If I have to stay with that file I can improve the follow things:

1. I will move pass $hospitalId to the function getHospitalPatients() as parameter and will remove global $request
2. I will validate $hospitalId better - it must be an integer that is greater than 0.
3. I will move the namespaces in the "use" header of the file so that I will use short class names.
5. When I call $hospitalRepository->selectById($hospitalId) I will check the result. It depends how selectById() is implemented - it can throw an exception or return null if there is no hospital with passed ID. If there is no such hospital we can't call $patientRepository->selectByHospital($hospital).
6. The results "hospital" and "patients" in the JSON response must be converted to arrays otherwise there will be no data in the response about them.
7. return getHospitalPatients() will not do the job, because it will send nothing through HTTP. I have to make an instance of Symfony kernel and to use it to handle the response or manually to set the response header to text/json and output the content from the ResponseJson object.
